# Library Project

## Getting Started

1. Open your command line and navigate to your `repos` directory (if you do not have a `repos` folder, then you can use `mkdir repos` to create one)
2. Use this template repository to start a new project in your repos folder: `git clone <repo_name>`
3. cd `repo_name` to navigate into your new repo directory
4. Start Visual Studio Code and select 'Open Folder'. Then select `repo_name` to open the folder in the editor (or just type `code .` in your terminal inside the repo directory)
5. Follow the instructions on the README.md file to complete exercises
6. Open the index.html file to get started

## Instructions

- In your index.html

1. Add a label and input box for the title
2. Add a label and input box for the author
3. Add a label and checkbox for the read property
4. Add a submit button to add a new book

- In your app.js

1. Create a class `Book` that has the following properties:
   - Title (string)
   - Author (string)
   - Read (boolean)
2. Create a class `Library` that has the following properties and methods:
   - Book count (number)
   - Books (array of books)
   - `markRead` method that will:
     - Take in a parameter `checkbox` and `id`
     - Loop through the library books
     - If the book id is the same as the param id, change the book read property to true, the `checkbox` checked attribute to true, and the `checked` disabled attribute to true
   - `addBook` method that will:
     - Select the title input value, author input value, and read checkbox value
     - Use the book constructor to create a new book, passing in the input value, author value, and read checkbox value as params
     - Create a new table row
     - Create new table cells `title`, `author` and `read` properties of the newly added book
     - Append the new table cells to the newly created row
     - Select the table body
     - Append the new row to the table body
     - Increment library `bookCount` by one
3. Select the `Add Book` button from your index.html
4. Add an event listener to the button element that listens for a `click` event, and calls the library `addBook`

## BONUS

- Add a method to the `Library` class that removes a book from the `books` array
- Update your UI on the index.html page to have a `Remove` button per book item, with an event listener for 'click' events to call the `removeBook` Library method
- Hint: Use the book `id` property to find, then remove the book
